## Introduction
This repository contains the code to create a simple AI-powered pen attachment. The pen attachment is able to recognize the gestures of writing handwritten numerals from 0-7, with the help of a tiny Convolutional Neural Network model, optimized to run on the Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense.
